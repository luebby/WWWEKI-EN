<h2>Learning objectives</h2>
<p>In this module you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to determine a causal effect using linear regression in
<code>R</code> based on a real-world example;</li>
<li>how to determine which variables need to be adjusted in
practice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Smoking in children and adolescents</h2>
<p>So far we have mostly worked with simulated examples to work out the
basics of causal inference. Let us now apply what we have learned to
real data.</p>
<p>As with the human contributions to climate change, there is now
fairly widespread agreement on the question of whether smoking is
unhealthy.</p>
<p>But this was not always the case, and naive data analysis may even
lead to the opposite conclusion.</p>
<p>A number of papers (see, e.g., <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10691898.2005.11910559">Kahn, 2005</a>)
have addressed the question of the extent to which smoking affects the
so-called <em>forced expiratory volume</em> in adolescents. This is the
amount of air exhaled during a forced breath and the most important
measurement of lung function.</p>

<h2>The role of gender</h2>
<p>Both smoking and expiratory volume depend on gender.</p>
<p>Thus, if we additionally split by gender, we end up with the
following plot:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gf_boxplot(expiratory_volume ~ smoking | gender, data = LV)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Modul_11_files/figure-html/bedingtn-1.png" width="624" /></p>

higher expiratory volume.</p>
<p>Why could that be the case?</p>

<div id="section-the-role-of-age" class="section level2">
<h2>The role of age</h2>
<p>Of course there is also an association between body height and

  gf_smooth()</code></pre>
<p><img src="Modul_11_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>And one between age and body height:</p>

  gf_smooth()</code></pre>
<p><img src="Modul_11_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And between smoking and age:</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: The linear model here is only a pragmatic
approximation because there are non-linear relationships between age and
height and height and expiratory_volume. To estimate the effect of
smoking more accurately, these nonlinear relationships should be modeled
in a truly nonlinear fashion.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-simpsons-paradox" class="section level2">
<h2>Simpson’s paradox</h2>
<p>In this example, you have learned that observed associations can
differ significantly from the true causal associations – even to the
point that a positive association is observed when the true causal
effect is actually negative. This is an example of the so-called
<strong>Simpson’s paradox</strong>.</p>

</div>
<div id="section-outlook-adjustment-sets" class="section level2">
<h2>Outlook: Adjustment Sets</h2>
<p>Of course, for the relationship between smoking and expiratory
volume, you could always create a much more complex graph containing
numerous potential confounders.</p>
<p>If we assume such a larger graph, would we always have to adjust for
all confounders?</p>
<p>In fact, there are some situations where unbiased effects can be
estimated even with fewer control variables. This is because sometimes
single variables lie on multiple confounding paths. Thus, accounting for
a single variable can sometimes solve several “problems” at once.</p>
<p>Whether the adjustment for a set of variables (for an <em>adjustment
set</em>) is sufficient to identify a causal effect of interest can be
determined using, among other things, the so-called <em>back-door
criterion</em>. If you are interested in the precise formulation of this
criterion, you can learn about it in Judea Pearl’s article <a
href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/R218-B.pdf">“Causal Diagrams for
Empirical Research”</a>. Exemplary examples for the effects of control
variables are provided in <a
href="https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r493.pdf">“A Crash Course in
Good and Bad Controls”</a> by Cinelli et al.</p>
<p>Sufficient adjustment sets can be determined algorithmically, which
is quite convenient once graphs get more complex. For example, if you
draw the assumed causal graph in <a
href="http://dagitty.net/">DAGitty</a> (see Module 10), the software
automatically determines all existing <em>minimally sufficient
adjustment sets</em>, i.e. the smallest possible adjustment sets that
are sufficient to identify the causal effect.</p>
