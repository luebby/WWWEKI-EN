## Learning objectives

In this module you will learn:

- how to distinguish between description, prediction, and causal inference,

- why this distinction is important, and

- more about the causal ladder.

## Data Literacy

According to the [Data Literacy Charta](https://www.stifterverband.org/sites/default/files/data-literacy-charter.pdf), **data literacy**:

> Data literacy is the ability to collect, manage, evaluate, and apply data in a critical manner. If the data is to support decision-making processes, competent answers to four basic questions are needed:
- What do I want to do with data? 
- What can I do with data? 
- What am I allowed to do with data? 
- What should I do with data?

In this module we address the question: ***What do I want to do with data?***
What goal do I pursue with data analysis? 
Do I use the data to describe a phenomenon? 
Or do I use the data to predict something? 
Is it about causal inference in the end? 
Depending on the goal of the data analysis, different methods are appropriate.

The following examples are by [Hernán et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09332480.2019.1579578).

## Description

Often, data is used with the goal of describing a phenomenon. An example from health care:

:::{.box}
How can women aged 60–80 years with stroke history be partitioned in classes defined by their characteristics?	
:::

For example, to investigate the proportion of female smokers in this group, graphical methods can be used (e.g., simple bar charts); statistical ratios (e.g., percentage of female smokers); depending on the question and the data basis, also methods of inferential statistics (p&#8209;values, confidence intervals, Bayesian statistics). 

Methods like cluster analysis or principal component analysis can also be used to characterize the group more precisely. 

```{r beschreibung, echo=FALSE}
question("Do such data analyses automatically lead to correct descriptions of the phenomenon under study?",
         answer("Yes"),
         answer("No", correct = TRUE, message = "Data are usually only part of a complex and dynamic reality. Data could be subject to measurement error; for example, past smoking behavior may not be correctly remembered or reported. Non-representative samples can also be a problem; for example, it may be precisely more health-conscious women who are more likely to participate in surveys in the first place. Furthermore, missing values can lead to biased results; for example, certain women may refuse to answer some of the questions. So even in pure description, data can be misleading. To evaluate this possibility, we need to critically consider how the data were actually generated and collected. The interview in module 06 with Richard McElreath will address causal thinking for descriptive research in more depth."),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         correct = random_praise(),
         incorrect = random_encouragement()
         )
```

## Prediction

Prediction is another goal of data analysis:

:::{.box}
What is the probability of having a stroke next year for women with certain characteristics?
:::

Here, there is a concrete event that is to be predicted on the basis of other variables. 
Many methods of artificial intelligence and machine learning try to solve exactly this type of task. 
Common methods include different types of regression models, but artificial neural networks are also used. 
Prediction is often involved in algorithmic decision systems.

***

*Note*: Many applications are associated with certain ethical responsibility, which are further discussed in the AI Campus course [Daten- und Algorithmenethik](https://ki-campus.org/courses/daethik2020).

***

On an abstract level, the aim is to model the value of a target variable $\color{blue}{Y}$ (stroke yes or no) based on 
 other variables that have been collected $\color{green}{X}$ (here e.g. smoking, but also medication intake) ($\color{blue}{Y} = f(\color{green}{X})$).
The estimated model can then be used to predict values of $\color{blue}{Y}$.

Let's practice with a different example:

```{r vorhersage, echo=FALSE}
question("A company wants to use existing data to identify those customers who could be interested in a new offer from the company. Is this a data application with the goal of prediction?",
         answer("Yes", correct = TRUE, message = "Here, we use existing information about customers to calculate the probability that they will buy a certain product. In the next step, one could target those customers and and inform them about the product."),
         answer("No"),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         correct = random_praise(),
         incorrect = random_encouragement()
         )
```

## Causal inference

For description and prediction, the data are only *observed.*

So no intervention took place, even if in the next step, the prediction may be used to guide concrete actions.

In causal inference, in contrast, we are interested in the consequences of (hypothetical) interventions.

One question involving causal inference is:

:::{.box}
Will starting a statin reduce, on average, the risk of stroke in women with certain characteristics?
:::

Basic considerations and procedures that can help answer such questions will be taught over the course of this course.


## Description, prediction, or causal inference?

Here's yet another example from a different context:

```{r anwendung, echo=FALSE}
question("In the context of customer relationship management, customer churn is an important issue. What is the underlying goal of using data to answer the question: *Which customers have had a high churn rate in the past?*",
         answer("Description", correct = TRUE, message = "Existing data is used to characterize customers who left. For an example, and how churn could also be considered from a predictive or causal perspective, see e.g. [Bojinov et al. (2020)](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/wjhth9tr/release/1)"),
         answer("Prediction"),
         answer("Causal inference"),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         correct = random_praise(),
         incorrect = random_encouragement()
         )
```

## The causal ladder

In addition to this distinction between the three analysis goals of description, prediction, and causal inference, [Judea Pearl](https://doi.org/10.1145/3241036) distinguishes between three levels of causal modeling.
You already learned about them in the interview with Stephan Poppe, and we will go into detail about each of them.

1.  **Association**: $Pr(y|x)$ &ndash; Observe: *What is*? How likely is $Y=y$, given that I observe $X=x$? 

2.  **Intervention**: $Pr(y|do(x))$ &ndash; Intervene: *What if*? How likely is $Y=y$, if I assign $X=x$, i.e., if I actually intervene in the world?

3.  **Counterfactuals**: $Pr(y_x|x',y')$ &ndash; Imagine: *What would have been*? We observed $X=x'$ and, in consequence, $Y=y'$. How likely would have been $Y=y$, if I had intervened and set $X=x$? (See Module 09)


The first level, association, is relevant for the two goals description and prediction.
In Module 08, you will learn more about how description and prediction vary in the demands they put on the data.
On level two and three, intervention and counterfactuals, we are already pursuing the goal of causal inference.


***

*Note*: $Pr(y|x)$ is the conditional probability of $y$ given $x$. 
This is the probability that $y$ occurs, when $x$ has occured.
Usually, this value will be different from the unconditional probability $Pr(y)$.

***

```{r do, echo=FALSE}
question("Are the probabilities for $y$ in the case of association $Pr(y|x)$ versus intervention $Pr(y|do(x))$ always the same?",
         answer("Yes"),         
         answer("No", correct = TRUE,  message = "A simple example: the probability that someone is healthy ($y$) who owns swimming goggles ($x$) is relatively high (association, e.g. 70% of swimming goggle owners are healthy). But an intervention in which we hand out swimming goggles (intervention, $do(x)$) would not result in 70% of people being healthy. Song for this: [Monty Harper: Correlation Does Not Imply Causation](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/resources/fun/songs/correlation-does-not-imply-causation)"),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         correct = random_praise(),
         incorrect = random_encouragement()
         )
```
