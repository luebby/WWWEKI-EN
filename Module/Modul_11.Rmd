## Learning objectives

In this module you will learn:

- how to determine a causal effect using linear regression in `R` based on a real-world example;
- how to determine which variables need to be adjusted in practice.


## Smoking in children and adolescents

So far we have mostly worked with simulated examples to work out the basics of causal inference. 
Let us now apply what we have learned to real data.

As with the human contributions to climate change, there is now fairly widespread agreement on the question of whether smoking is unhealthy.

But this was not always the case, and naive data analysis may even lead to the opposite conclusion.

A number of papers (see, e.g., [Kahn, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1080/10691898.2005.11910559)) have addressed the question of the extent to which smoking affects the so-called *forced expiratory volume* in adolescents.
This is the amount of air exhaled during a forced breath and the most important measurement of lung function.



```{r ethik, echo=FALSE}
question("Would it be ethical to run a randomized experiment to address this question?",
  answer("Yes."),
  answer("No.", correct = TRUE, message = "Negative health consequences are to be expected in participants who are assigned to be smokers as part of the experiment. However, as you heard in the interview with Anne Bren√∏e, variations of the manipulation could be ethically defensible &ndash; for example, one could randomly assign who gets to participate in a smoking cessation intervention."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  correct = random_praise(),
  incorrect = random_encouragement()
)
```

##


Let's prepare everything for our data analysis in `R`:

```{r str}
# load package
library(mosaic)
# read data, see https://doi.org/10.1080/10691898.2005.11910559
LV <- read.table("http://jse.amstat.org/datasets/fev.dat.txt", 
                 col.names = c("age", "expiratory_volume", "height", "gender",	"smoking"))
# recode variables
LV <- LV %>%
  mutate(gender = case_when(gender == 0 ~ "f",
                                gender == 1 ~ "m"),
         smoking = case_when(smoking == 0 ~ "no",
                               smoking == 1 ~ "yes")) %>%
  mutate(height = height * 2.54)
# data structure
str(LV)
```

Data table `LV` contains $n=`r nrow(LV)`$ observations and $`r ncol(LV)`$ variables:

- `age`: age in years
- `expiratory_volume`: forced expiratory volume in liters 
- `height`: body height in centimeters
- `gender`: `m` for male, `f` for female
- `smoking`: Does the person smoke? `yes` or `no`

Let's take a look at the data from [Kahn, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1080/10691898.2005.11910559) :

```{r head, echo = FALSE}
datatable(LV)
```


##

Because of substantive considerations, we assume the following causal relationships between variables:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p1
```

Remember, these are adolescents -- hence the assumption that smoking can affect height.

## Smoking and expiratory volume

Here is a boxplot showing the expiratory volume for smokers and non-smokers

```{r b1}
gf_boxplot(expiratory_volume ~ smoking, data = LV) %>%
  gf_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0, alpha = 0.15) 
```

```{r median, echo=FALSE}
question("Which of the two groups has the higher median expiratory volume?",
  answer("Those who do not smoke."),
  answer("Those who do smoke.", correct = TRUE, message = "The median volume for non-smokers is at ca. 2.5 l, for smokers it is at ca. 3.2 l."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  correct = random_praise(),
  incorrect = random_encouragement())
```

## The role of gender

Both smoking and expiratory volume depend on gender.

Thus, if we additionally split by gender, we end up with the following plot:

```{r bedingtn}
gf_boxplot(expiratory_volume ~ smoking | gender, data = LV)
```


But the overall picture remains unchanged: smokers seem to have the higher expiratory volume. 


Why could that be the case?

## The role of age

Of course there is also an association between body height and expiratory volume:


```{r, message=FALSE}
gf_point(expiratory_volume ~ height, data = LV) %>%
  gf_smooth()
```

And one between age and body height:

```{r, message=FALSE}
gf_point(height ~ age, data = LV) %>%
  gf_smooth()
```

<br>

And between smoking and age:


```{r, message=FALSE}
gf_boxplot(age ~ smoking, data = LV) %>%
  gf_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0.2, alpha = 0.15) 
```

## Causal modeling of smoking and expiratory volume

As a reminder, here is the causal graph we want to assume:

```{r p12, echo=FALSE}
p1
```


A naive analysis that ignores all third variables results in the following conclusion, which we have already glimpsed from the initial boxplot:


```{r}
lm(expiratory_volume ~ smoking, data = LV) %>%
  summary()
```

Smokers appear to have a higher expiratory volume:

$$\widehat{\text{expiratory_volume}} = 2.57 + 0.71 \cdot \begin{cases} 1 &: \text{smoking = yes} \\ 0&: \text{smoking = no} \end{cases}$$

##

```{r p123, echo=FALSE}
p1
```

This connection is distorted because of open non-causal *backdoor* paths:

$$\text{Smoking} \leftarrow \text{Gender} \rightarrow \text{Expiratory volume}$$
as well as

$$\text{Smoking} \leftarrow \text{Age} \rightarrow \text{Expiratory volume}$$
So these paths should be *blocked* through third-variable adjustment.


```{r chain, echo=FALSE}
question("Shoudl we additionally adjust for `height`?",
  answer("Yes."),
  answer("No.", correct = TRUE, message = "The variable `height` is on the causal path (*chain*) between `smoking` and `expiratory_volume` (*mediator*). Such mediators should not be adjusted. What would happen here if we included it in the model anyway? We would adjust away real differences caused by smoking and thereby underestimate the total effects of smoking on expiratory volume."),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         correct = random_praise(),
         incorrect = random_encouragement())
```

##

Enter the formula to estimate the (total) causal effect of smoking on respiratory volume under the assumptions of a linear model.

As a reminder, the names of the variables in the data set were <br> 
`age`, `expiratory_volume`, `height`, `gender` and `smoking`.

```{r model, exercise = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
lm(expiratory_volume ~ smoking + ___ + ___, data = LV) %>%
  summary()
```

```{r model-hint}
"Add the variables that need to be adjusted according to the causal graph, gender and age."
```

```{r model-solution}
lm(expiratory_volume ~ smoking + gender + age, data = LV) %>%
  summary()
```


```{r effekt, echo=FALSE}
question("In this model, does smoking have the expected negative effect on expiratory volume?",
  answer("Yes.", correct = TRUE, message = "The estimated coefficient (`estimate`) for the variable of interest (`smokingyes `) is negative $-0.153974$ ."),
  answer("No."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  correct = random_praise(),
  incorrect = random_encouragement())
```

*Note*: The linear model here is only a pragmatic approximation because there are non-linear relationships between age and height and height and expiratory_volume. To estimate the effect of smoking more accurately, these nonlinear relationships should be modeled in a truly nonlinear fashion.

## Simpson's paradox

In this example, you have learned that observed associations can differ significantly from the true causal associations &ndash; even to the point that a positive association is observed when the true causal effect is actually negative.
This is an example of the so-called **Simpson's paradox**.

## Outlook: Adjustment Sets

Of course, for the relationship between smoking and expiratory volume, you could always create a much more complex graph containing numerous potential confounders.

If we assume such a larger graph, would we always have to adjust for all confounders?


In fact, there are some situations where unbiased effects can be estimated even with fewer control variables.
This is because sometimes single variables lie on multiple confounding paths.
Thus, accounting for a single variable can sometimes solve several "problems" at once.


Whether the adjustment for a set of variables (for an *adjustment set*) is sufficient to identify a causal effect of interest can be determined using, among other things, the so-called *back-door criterion*.
If you are interested in the precise formulation of this criterion, you can learn about it in Judea Pearl's article ["Causal Diagrams for Empirical Research"](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/R218-B.pdf). 
Exemplary examples for the effects of control variables are provided in ["A Crash Course in Good and Bad Controls"](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r493.pdf) by Cinelli et al.


Sufficient adjustment sets can be determined algorithmically, which is quite convenient once graphs get more complex.
For example, if you draw the assumed causal graph in [DAGitty](http://dagitty.net/) (see Module 10), the software automatically determines all existing *minimally sufficient adjustment sets*, i.e. the smallest possible adjustment sets that are sufficient to identify the causal effect.
