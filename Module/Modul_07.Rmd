## Learning objectives

In this module you will learn:

- that an observation does not always allow us to derive a suitable action.

## Real estate prices

What determines the value of a property?

One factor that is particularly easy to determine is the number of rooms. 
This criterion is also often used for marketing in the USA.

In the `R` package `mosaicData` there is a data set containing real estate records: `SaratogaHouses`.
It contains data on houses in Saratoga County, New York, USA, in 2006.

Let's have a look at the relation between number of rooms (`rooms`) and price (`price`):

```{r desi, warning=FALSE}
# Load data and packages
library(mosaic)
data(SaratogaHouses)

# scatter plot
gf_point(price ~ rooms, data = SaratogaHouses) %>%
  gf_lm() # add regression line
```

As you can see: The average price increases with the number of rooms.

## Linear regression - first attempt

Let us assume a linear relationship between <green>number of rooms</green> (`rooms`), $\color{green}{x}$, and <blue>price</blue> (`price`), $\color{blue}{y}$:

$$\color{blue}{y}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \color{green}{x}_i + \epsilon_i$$
$\beta_1$ is the slope describing the linear relationship, $\beta_0$ is the $y$-intercept

We can use the data to estimate the two coefficients $\beta_0, \beta_1$:

```{r lm1}
erglm1 <- lm(price ~ rooms, data = SaratogaHouses)
erglm1
```

Resulting in:

$$\hat{\color{blue}{y}}_i = `r round(coef(erglm1))[1]` + `r round(coef(erglm1))[2]` \cdot \color{green}{x}_i $$

```{r Steigung, echo=FALSE}
message <- "The slope estimated from the sample in the linear model is $\\hat{\\beta}_1= 22573$.  $\\hat{\\beta}_0=53016$ is the estimated y-intercept, that is, the mean of the price at $x=0$ rooms."
question("In the linear model describing the sample, by how much does the price increase per room?",
         answer("53016"),
         answer("22573", correct = TRUE, message = message),
		allow_retry = TRUE,
		correct = random_praise(),
		incorrect = random_encouragement()
         )
```

##

If a house has 4 separated rooms according to the floor plan, <green>number of rooms</green> (`rooms`), is $\color{green}{x}=\color{green}{4}$.

Thus, the estimated price is

$$\hat{\color{blue}{y}} = `r round(coef(erglm1))[1]` + `r round(coef(erglm1))[2]` \cdot \color{green}{4}= \color{blue}{`r round(coef(erglm1))[1]+  round(coef(erglm1))[2]*4`}.$$

</span>

Now you could have a seemingly brilliant idea: Just divide the living room.
One becomes two, $4$ rooms turn into $5$, $do(\color{green}{x}=\color{green}{5})$. 
Then, according to the model:

$$\hat{\color{blue}{y}} = `r round(coef(erglm1))[1]` + `r round(coef(erglm1))[2]` \cdot \color{green}{5}= \color{blue}{`r round(coef(erglm1))[1]+  round(coef(erglm1))[2]*5`}.$$

```{r Wertsteigerung, echo=FALSE}
message <- "The estimated linear model of the sample refers to the observed data ($X=x$), i.e., the slope describes the observed change in the mean, not the effect of an action $do(X=x)$ (see also Module 2)."
question("Does such a room divsion increase the price of the property by $22573$ on average?",
         answer("Yes"),
         answer("No", correct = TRUE, message = message),
		allow_retry = TRUE,
		correct = random_praise(),
		incorrect = random_encouragement()
         )
```

## Repetition: Elements of Causal Diagrams

In Modules 4, 5 and 6 you have learned the basic elements of causal diagrams:


| Path                       | $\color{green}{X} \rightarrow \color{violet}{Z} \rightarrow \color{blue}{Y}$ | $\color{green}{X} \leftarrow \color{violet}{Z} \rightarrow \color{blue}{Y}$  | $\color{green}{X} \rightarrow \color{violet}{Z} \leftarrow \color{blue}{Y}$ 
| :--------------------------|:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Name                       | Chain                           | Fork                           | Inverted fork         
| Association between $\color{green}{X}$ and $\color{blue}{Y}$     | causal                          | non-causal                    | no association                       
| Role of $\color{violet}{Z}$              | Mediator                        | Confounder                      | Collider
| Adjustment of $\color{violet}{Z}$           | Blocks causal path       | Blocks non-causal path | Opens non-causal path

How can we estimate causal effects from observational data, given these rules?

**The basic idea**: To estimate the change in $\color{blue}{y}$ when $\color{green}{x}$ is changed, all non-causal paths (*forks*) should be blocked. 
At the same time, causal paths (*chains*) should not be blocked.
Moreover, non-causal paths (*inverted forks*) should not be opened. 
So while we should adjust for $\color{violet}{Z}$ in a fork, this should not happen in a chain or inverted fork.

Considering the relationship between <green>number of rooms</green> and <blue>price</blue>: What *confounder* might be present?

*Please think about it for a moment before you press `Next`*.

##

<violet>Living space</violet> could be a common cause of <green>number of rooms</green> and <blue>price</blue>.
Larger houses usually have more rooms and also cost more.

```{r DAG_Fork, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='85%'}
plot(DAG_Fork)
```

In this simple graph, we can now focus on specific aspects.

```{r graph2, echo=FALSE}
message <- "Apart from the direct effect via $X \\rightarrow Y$, there is also the non-causal $X \\leftarrow Z \\rightarrow Y$. Here, **area** is a **confounder**."
question("Suppose we are interested in the relationship between the number of rooms and the price, given the area.
Which structure does the subgraph correspond to?",
         answer("Chain"),
         answer("Fork", correct = TRUE, message = message),
         answer("Inverted fork"),
		allow_retry = TRUE,
		correct = random_praise(),
		incorrect = random_encouragement()
         )
```


```{r graph1, echo=FALSE}
message <- "Apart from the direct effect via $Z \\rightarrow Y$, there is also the indirect $Z \\rightarrow X \\rightarrow Y$. Here the **number of rooms** is a **mediator**."
question("Suppose we are interested in the relationship between area and price via the number of rooms. Which structure does the subgraph correspond to?",
         answer("Chain", correct = TRUE, message = message),
         answer("Fork"),
         answer("Inverted fork"),
		allow_retry = TRUE,
		correct = random_praise(),
		incorrect = random_encouragement()
         )
```


## Linear regression - second attempt

If living area is a confounder, we should adjust for this variable to estimate the causal effect of number of rooms.


<violet>Living area</violet> is present in the data table as the variable `livingArea`. Complete the model accordingly.

```{r lm, exercise=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
lm(price ~ rooms, data = SaratogaHouses)
```

```{r lm-solution}
lm(price ~ rooms + livingArea, data = SaratogaHouses)
```

What do you notice?

##

```{r lms}
# Model without living area
lm(price ~ rooms, data = SaratogaHouses)
# Model with living area
lm(price ~ rooms + livingArea, data = SaratogaHouses)
```

Given the <violet>living area</violet>, the effect of the <green>number of rooms</green> on the <blue>price</blue> is much smaller. 
Instead of an estimated slope of $\hat{\beta}_1=`r round(coef(erglm1))[2]`$ in the model *without* accounting for <violet>living area</violet>, we find  $\hat{\beta}_1=`r round(coef(erglm2))[2]`$ *with* accounting for it.

Even though this is still a highly simplified model, the estimated causal effect of the number of rooms on price is at least more realistic in the model with living area (`price ~ rooms + livingArea`) than in the one without (`price ~ rooms`).
Of course, there may be additional confounders that should be taken into account.


##

```{r DAG_Fork2, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='85%'}
plot(DAG_Fork)
```

```{r adjustierung, echo=FALSE}
message <- "Which variables to include in the model depends on which causal effect is to be determined. Here, the model `price ~ livingArea + rooms` would interrupt the (indirect) causal path from area to rooms to price. The correct model would therefore be `price ~ livingArea`."
question("Suppose we want to analyze the expected change in price when living area is increased. Should we then adjust for the number of rooms?",
         answer("Yes", message = "Which variables to include in the model depends on which causal effect we want to determine."),
         answer("No",correct = TRUE, message = message),
		allow_retry = TRUE,
		correct = random_praise(),
		incorrect = random_encouragement()
         )
```
