\]</span></p>
<p>We hope that this course with its examples has helped you think more
clearly about systematic <em>bias</em> and how it can be addressed.</p>

variation and is a topic that is covered in more depth in courses on

<h2>The problem with simplified examples</h2>
<p>In this course, you have learned how to define causal effects and how
to use causal graphs to map assumptions and infer valid conclusions
<em>under those assumptions</em>.</p>
<p>But all graphs you saw were highly simplified and contained only few
variables. Reality, of course, looks much more complex – graphs can
contain hundreds of variables, including often ones that are hard to
measure or even unobservable.</p>
<p>Even worse, in many situations, we simply do not know what the
underlying causal graph looks like.</p>

<div id="section-perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good" class="section level2">
<h2>Perfect is the enemy of good</h2>
<p>But that is no reason to throw in the towel!</p>
<p>Conclusions are always subject to certain uncertainties. Even if you
know the underlying causal network perfectly well, random noise can
still lead to wrong results. And even highly complex scientific models
are always a simplified representation of reality.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> In her book <a
href="https://www.angelapotochnik.com/idealization.html">“Idealization
and the Aims of Science”</a>, philosopher of science Angela Potochnik
deals at length with the central role that simplifications play in
science – even in hard sciences like physics.</p>
<hr />
<p>Even if we do not know the full causal graph, knowledge of the
fundamental causal structures helps us to critically question causal
inferences and to identify possible biases.</p>

<div id="section-example-1-coffee-and-miscarriages"
class="section level2">
<h2>Example 1: Coffee and miscarriages</h2>
<p>Observational studies report a correlation between coffee in
pregnancy and miscarriages. A causal effect is not necessarily
implausible here: caffeine can cross the placenta in pregnant women.
That’s why it’s often recommended to avoid coffee (and other caffeinated
beverages) altogether during pregnancy. But is there really a causal
effect that justifies this recommendation?</p>
<p>Coffee consumption during pregnancy depends on many factors. For
example, especially in the first trimester, many women suffer from
nausea, which makes coffee a lot less enjoyable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, another line of studies suggests that nausea and
vomiting in pregnancy are <em>negatively</em> correlated with
miscarriage risk. One possible explanation is that the nausea is caused
by hormones that are abundant in a healthy pregnancy.</p>

<p>Studies that adjust for nausea as a variable on a potentially
confounding pathway (<span class="math inline">\(coffee \leftarrow
nausea \leftarrow U \rightarrow miscarriage\)</span>) tend to find
weaker associations between coffee consumption and miscarriage risk.</p>
<p>The idea that nausea is on a confounding pathway is also supported by
the fact that studies overall find less consistent associations between
miscarriage and consumption of other caffeinated beverages (e.g., tea or
cola). While these contain caffeine, they are often found to be less
revolting for pregnant women suffering from nausea.</p>
<p>All things considered, the <a
href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2010/08/moderate-caffeine-consumption-during-pregnancy">American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (2020)</a> concludes that
moderate caffeine consumption (less than 200mg per day) does not appear
to be a risk factor. At this point in time, no firm conclusion can be
drawn regarding larger doses of caffeine in pregnancy.</p>

nausea, and miscarriages is discussed in more detail in the book
“Expecting Better” by economist Emily Oster.</p>

<div id="section-example-2-life-expectancy-in-hunter-gatherer-societies"
class="section level2">
<h2>Example 2: Life expectancy in hunter-gatherer societies</h2>
<p>Here is an example that has already come up in the interview with
Richard McElreath.</p>
<p>Consistent evidence suggests that in prehistoric hunter-gatherer
societies, life expectancy at birth was much lower than it is today, at
about 25 years.</p>
<p>However, some people argue that this low figure is primarily due to
high infant and child mortality. If prehistoric people made it to
adolescence, they often survived to old age.</p>
<p>Similar observations are made for modern hunter-gatherer societies:
While mortality is significantly higher at the beginning of life, it
decreases radically as soon as the first years have been survived. A
life span of 70 years then becomes nothing unusual.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-back-to-the-stone-age" class="section level2">
<h2>Back to the stone age?</h2>
<p>These observations are sometimes invoked to make arguments about
different lifestyles.</p>
<p>If hunter-gatherers often live to such a ripe old age despite a lack
of modern health care, does that suggest that their lifestyle is
particularly healthy?</p>
<p>In the end, could one even conclude that modern medicine is not doing
much to make us live longer?</p>
<p>That the situation for complications at birth and in young years has
improved is clear. But what happens afterwards? Perhaps the benefits
that modern medicine brings us are offset by the increased risk of
succumbing to so-called diseases of civilization?</p>
</div>
<div id="section-survival-graph" class="section level2">
<h2>Survival graph</h2>
<p>But before diving into such speculation, we should first think about
how these data – low life expectancy at birth, high life expectancy
<em>after surviving childhood</em> – come about.</p>

<p>People differ from birth in certain factors that are influenced by
genes. For example, some people are particularly susceptible to
infections, others are more fortunate and have fitter immune
systems.</p>
<p>We have summarized all such differences here under the label
<em>Intrinsic robustness</em>.</p>
<p>Now we are interested in how much the society we live in (traditional
hunter-gatherer vs. modern) influences whether we live to see our 70th
birthday – independent of the effects on survival to the 5th
birthday.</p>

<h2></h2>
<p>If we calculate life expectancy for a person who has reached age 5,
separately for the two types of society, then our analyses are
conditioning on the variable “Surviving until age 5.” But this is a
collider on the path between “Intrinsic Robustness” and “Type of
Society.” Thus, our analyses lead to a non-causal correlation between
intrinsic robustness and type of society.</p>
<p>The comparison of the two life expectancies conditional on survival
to age 5 is thus a biased estimator for the direct effect of “type of
society” on “to 70 survival.”</p>
<p>On a substantive level, this is actually quite intuitive. Anyone who
survives a few years in a society with numerous risks to survival must
be relatively robust by disposition. Those who grow up in a society with
few risks and good health care have good chances of survival, even if
they are affected by certain potential health vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The population of people over 5 in hunter-gatherer societies is thus
“by design” quite different from the population of people over 5 in
modern societies. A naive comparison of these two populations mixes
effects of the type of society on survival with spurious correlations
that are induced by the “selection filter” of survival into
childhood.</p>
<p>So from these data alone, we cannot yet draw any firm conclusions
about the advantages or disadvantages of certain lifestyles for
longevity.</p>
<p>An experiment in which we randomly assign children who have reached a
certain age to grow up in a different type of society is of course only
feasible as a thought experiment. But we could try to approximate the
outcome of such an experiment with available observational data.
However, to do so, we can’t just compare different life expectancies –
we need to start to take additional third variables into account, such
as the existince of certain potential health vulnerabilities.</p>

<div id="section-methods-for-third-variable-adjustment"
class="section level3">
<h3>Methods for third variable adjustment</h3>
<p>In this course, you have learned that third variables should
sometimes be included in analyses – and sometimes not, depending on the
role they play in the causal graph. Such adjustment can be made in a
variety of ways. For example, in the course you saw that variables can
be included as predictors in a linear regression model. But other
statistical approaches are also possible, such as splitting the sample
(stratification) or calculating propensity scores (see interview with
Dean Eckles on social contagion). Machine learning methods are also
applied for this purpose.</p>

<div id="section-natural-experiments" class="section level3">
<h3>Natural Experiments</h3>
<p>In this course, you learned about the magic of chance that makes
randomized experiments such a useful tool for causal inference. Between
randomized experiments and “pure” observational data, there are also
so-called natural experiments. In these, you take advantage of the fact
that in everyday life sometimes things are practically decided by
chance.</p>
<p>You have already heard about a first example of a natural experiment
in the interview with Anne Brenøe on the subject of the <em>effects of
breastfeeding</em>: whether a pregnant woman gives birth during the week
or on the weekend is in principle random, but can have an influence on
whether and how long she will breastfeed after the birth.</p>
<p>In this domain, analysis are often conducted with the help of
<strong>instrumental variables</strong>, using a <strong>regression
discontinuity</strong> design, or with a
<strong>difference-in-difference</strong> approach</p>
<p>Works in this area where honored with the 2021 Nobel Memorial Prize
in Economic Sciences, awarded to David Card, Joshua Angrist and Guido
Imbens.</p>
<p>How these methods can be used to address important questions has been
summarized by the Swedish Academy of Sciences <a

<h3>Causal Discovery</h3>
<p>In this course, we have often assumed that the underlying causal
graph is known a priori. But what if this is not the case? Then we have
to move into the area of causal discovery, where the goal is to infer a
plausible causal graph supported by the data. In the last three
interviews with Jakob Runge, Jonas Peters and Sebastian Weichwald, you
have already gained a glimpse into this complex of topics.</p>

<div id="section-data-fusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Fusion</h3>
<p>From a bird’s eye view, there are many data sources that can be
consulted to learn more about causes and effects. In general, none of
them is perfect. Observational studies often suffer from unobserved
confounders. But in experiments, not all subjects always do what we want
them to do, and sometimes we have to rely on other populations – for
example, in the initial stages of drug approval, on cell cultures and
animal studies. Lack of data and selective sampling further complicate
the situation. The idea of causal fusion is that we can still use all
these data sources <em>in combination</em> to arrive at the best
possible causal conclusions.</p>
