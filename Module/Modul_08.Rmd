## Learning objectives

In this module you will learn more about:

- the different data requirements for description and prediction, 

- the advantages of randomly drawn samples, and

- the advantages of random assignment in the context of experiments.


## Reducing overweight through breastfeeding?

A <red>fictive</red> study reports these results:

```{r, out.width="90%", echo = FALSE}
graduate <- c(rep(0, 70), rep(1, 30))
set.seed(1954)
breastfeeding <- numeric(100)
poverweight <- numeric(100)
overweight <- numeric(100)
for(i in 1:100) 
  {
  breastfeeding[i] <- ifelse(graduate[i], 
                    sample(c(0,1),1, prob = c(0.1, 0.9)), 
                    sample(c(0,1),1, prob = c(0.4, 0.6)))
  poverweight[i] <- ifelse(graduate[i], 0.3, 0.5)
  poverweight[i] <- poverweight[i] - ifelse(breastfeeding[i], 0.2, 0)
  overweight[i] <- sample(c(0,1),1, prob = c(1-poverweight[i], poverweight[i]))
}

d <- crossing(x = 1:10,
              y = 1:10) %>%
  mutate(Overweight = overweight,
         graduate = graduate,
         breastfeeding = breastfeeding)

d2 <- d %>%
  mutate(Overweight = ifelse(Overweight, "Yes", "No")) %>%
  mutate(breastfeeding = ifelse(breastfeeding, "Breastfeeding: Yes", "Breastfeeding: No")) %>%
  mutate(graduate = ifelse(graduate, "Yes", "No")) 


gf_bar(~ Overweight | breastfeeding , data = d2, 
       fill = ~ Overweight) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#A9BCF5", "#0B2161")) +
  labs(title = "Study result", y="Frequency") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

As you can see: Children of women who <green>breastfed</green> exclusively for at least four months were less likely to be <blue>overweight</blue> at age six than children who weren't breastfed &ndash; in this fictive study.


This is the level of **description** (see Module 3).<br>
To reach the levels ***prediction*** and ***causal inference*** we need more. 
A helpful trick for this has been known by statisticians and scientists for a long time.

##

Let us start with a highly simplified model in which we assume the following causal relationships:


- Whether the child is <blue>overweight</blue> at age 6 potentially depends on whether they were  <green>breastfed</green> exclusively for the first four months (<purple>Yes</purple>, <orange>No</orange>).

- But <blue>overweight</blue> also depends on the level of education of the mother, here assessed with whether or not the mother is a college <violet>graduate</violet>.

- <green>Breastfeeding</green> (<purple>Yes</purple>, <orange>No</orange>) could also potentially depend on whether or not the mother is a college <violet>graduate</violet>.

This results in the following causal graph:

```{r DAG_Modell, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='90%', fig.asp = .7}
plot(DAG_Modell)
```

```{r graph1, echo=FALSE}
message <- "The subgraph breastfeeding $\\leftarrow$ graduate $\\rightarrow$ overweight is a fork."
question("What role does the variable graduate play between breastfeeding and overweight?",
         answer("Mediator"),
         answer("Confounder", correct = TRUE, message = message),
         answer("Collider"),
		allow_retry = TRUE,
		correct = random_praise(),
		incorrect = random_encouragement()
         )
```

So far, so good. 
But when working with real data, we have to take something else into account: We do not, of course, have data for all women with children, but only for a sample.


## Population and sample

Suppose that we are interested in a population in which 30% of women are graduates.
For example, a relevant population could be all mothers in a given country at a given time.

At least 4 months of full <green>breastfeeding</green> is color-coded with <purple>Yes (purple)</purple> and <orange>No (orange)</orange>:

```{r population, fig.showtext=TRUE, out.width="90%", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = .7, fig.align="center"}
set.seed(1954)
stipro <- rep(1,100)
graduate <- c(rep(0, 70), rep(1, 30))
set.seed(1954)
breastfeeding <- numeric(100)
for(i in 1:100) breastfeeding[i] <- ifelse(graduate[i], 
                                     sample(c(0,1),1, prob = c(0.1, 0.9)), 
                                     sample(c(0,1),1, prob = c(0.4, 0.6)))

graduate  <- fontawesome(ifelse(graduate , "fa-graduation-cap", "fa-female"))
breastfeeding <- ifelse(breastfeeding, "#7A378B", "#FF8811")

d <- crossing(x = 1:10,
              y = 1:10) %>%
  mutate(stipro = stipro,
         graduate = graduate,
         breastfeeding = breastfeeding)  %>%
  mutate(Sample = ifelse(stipro == 1, "Yes","No"))

pdp <- prop( ~ breastfeeding, data = d, success = "#7A378B")

ppop <- ggplot(d, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white", linewidth = .5, alpha = .2) +
  theme_void() +
  geom_text(family='fontawesome-webfont', size = 8, aes(label = graduate), colour = breastfeeding) +
  labs(title = "Population") +
  theme(legend.position = "none", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  guides(fill = "none")
ppop
```

In this target population, the probability of  <purple>breastfeeding</purple> is $`r pdp`$.

##

Usually we do not know the values in the *population*, we only have a *sample* available for our analyses.

<br>

Suppose that in our *data collection*, there is a relationship between the mother's level of education (<violet>graduate</violet>) and her participation in the study.
For example, in our fictitious data, it looks like graduates are more likely to become part of the sample:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='90%', fig.asp = .7}
plot(DAG_ModellG)
```

Now let's draw a sample!
Women who end up in our data are highlighted in color:

```{r gsti, fig.showtext=TRUE, out.width="90%", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = .7, fig.align="center"}
set.seed(1954)
stipro <- c(sample(c(rep(1,10), rep(0,60))),sample(c(rep(1,20), rep(0,10))))
graduate <- c(rep(0, 70), rep(1, 30))
set.seed(1954)
breastfeeding <- numeric(100)
for(i in 1:100) breastfeeding[i] <- ifelse(graduate[i], 
                                     sample(c(0,1),1, prob = c(0.1, 0.9)), 
                                     sample(c(0,1),1, prob = c(0.4, 0.6)))

graduate  <- fontawesome(ifelse(graduate , "fa-graduation-cap", "fa-female"))
breastfeeding <- ifelse(breastfeeding, "#7A378B", "#FF8811")

d <- crossing(x = 1:10,
              y = 1:10) %>%
  mutate(stipro = stipro,
         graduate = graduate,
         breastfeeding = breastfeeding)  %>%
  mutate(Sample = ifelse(stipro == 1, "Yes","No"))

dd <- d %>%
  filter(stipro == 1)
pdgs <- prop( ~ breastfeeding, data = dd, success = "#7A378B")

pgsti <- ggplot(d, aes(x = x, y = y, color = Sample)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white", linewidth = .5, aes(fill = Sample), alpha = .2) +
  theme_void() +
  geom_text(family='fontawesome-webfont', size = 8, aes(label = graduate), colour = breastfeeding) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#00998A","grey80")) +
  labs(title = "Convenience sample") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 
pgsti
```

```{r stipro, echo=FALSE}
message <- "Graduates are overrepresented."
question("Is this sample *representative* &ndash; can we use it to draw inferences about the population?",
         answer("Yes"),
         answer("No", correct = TRUE, message = message),
		allow_retry = TRUE,
		correct = random_praise(),
		incorrect = random_encouragement()
         )
```

##

In this *convenience sample*, the probability of <purple>breastfeeding</purple> is $`r round(pdgs,2)`=`r round(pdgs,2)*100`\%$ &ndash; and thus systematically too high.

We can use the sample result to *describe* it, but we cannot generalize or use the results to predict new data from the population of interest.

For example, if we wanted to use the data to predict whether a randomly selected woman was breastfeeding or not, our estimated probability of $Pr(\color{green}{\text{breastfeeding}} = \color{purple}{\text{Yes}}) = `r round(pdgs,2)`$ would be too high.

<br>

So we need *more* than just the sample...

## Random sampling

The problem is that our sample depends on a variable, <violet>graduate</violet>, on which in turn the variable under study, <green>breastfeeding</green>, depends.
Graduates are more likely to be part of the sample, and graduates breastfeed more often, so we overestimate the proportion of women who breastfeed fully for at least 4 months based on the sample.

This problem affects many surveys -- people with certain characteristics often prefer to participate, and these characteristics in turn are related to the object of study.

How can we make sure at this point that our sample doesn't fool us?

This is where randomness helps!

</span>

Random sampling removes the dependence of sample membership on the variable <violet>graduate</violet>.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='90%', fig.asp = .7}
plot(DAG_ModellS)
```

The sample then depends only on random chance, resulting, for example, in the following:

```{r fig.showtext=TRUE, out.width="90%", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = .7, fig.align="center"}
set.seed(1954)
stipro <- as.factor(sample(c(rep(1,30), rep(0,70))))
graduate <- c(rep(0, 70), rep(1, 30))
set.seed(1954)
breastfeeding <- numeric(100)
for(i in 1:100) breastfeeding[i] <- ifelse(graduate[i], 
                                     sample(c(0,1),1, prob = c(0.1, 0.9)), 
                                     sample(c(0,1),1, prob = c(0.4, 0.6)))

graduate  <- fontawesome(ifelse(graduate , "fa-graduation-cap", "fa-female"))
breastfeeding <- ifelse(breastfeeding, "#7A378B", "#FF8811")

d <- crossing(x = 1:10,
              y = 1:10) %>%
  mutate(stipro = stipro,
         graduate = graduate,
         breastfeeding = breastfeeding)  %>%
  mutate(Sample = ifelse(stipro == 1, "Yes","No"))

dd <- d %>%
  filter(stipro == 1)
pdz <- prop( ~ breastfeeding, data = dd, success = "#7A378B")

pzsti <- ggplot(d, aes(x = x, y = y, color = Sample)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white", linewidth = .5, aes(fill = Sample), alpha = .2) +
  theme_void() +
  geom_text(family='fontawesome-webfont', size = 8, aes(label = graduate), colour = breastfeeding) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#00998A", "grey80")) +
  labs(title = "Random sample") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
pzsti
```

In this random sample, the probability of <purple>breastfeeding</purple> is $`r round(pdz,2)`$ and no longer deviates systematically from the *true* probability in the target population. 

All remaining deviations are just random -- sometimes we will overestimate the true value, sometimes we will underestimate it.
And the larger the sample, the smaller the deviations we see when we sample repeatedly.

<br> 

Thanks to random sample, we can thus make reliable **predictions** about whether a randomly selected woman is breastfeeding or not.

But what about the analysis goal of *causal inference*? 


```{r ki, echo=FALSE}
message <- "Graduate is a confounder here and lies on a non-causal path from breastfeeding to overweight. Thus, our estimate of the causal effect would be biased."
question("Can the causal effect of breastfeeding on overweight be estimated by a direct comparison of children whose mothers did breastfeed vs. did not breastfeed?",
         answer("Yes"),
         answer("No", correct = TRUE, message = message),
		allow_retry = TRUE,
		correct = random_praise(),
		incorrect = random_encouragement()
         )
```

## Random assignment

```{r simbeob, include=FALSE}
graduate <- c(rep(0, 70), rep(1, 30))
set.seed(1954)
breastfeeding <- numeric(100)
poverweight <- numeric(100)
overweight <- numeric(100)
for(i in 1:100) 
  {
  breastfeeding[i] <- ifelse(graduate[i], 
                    sample(c(0,1),1, prob = c(0.1, 0.9)), 
                    sample(c(0,1),1, prob = c(0.4, 0.6)))
}

for(i in 1:100) 
  {
  poverweight[i] <- ifelse(graduate[i], 0.3, 0.5)
  poverweight[i] <- poverweight[i] - ifelse(breastfeeding[i], 0.2, 0)
  overweight[i] <- sample(c(0,1),1, prob = c(1-poverweight[i], poverweight[i]))
}

graduates <- fontawesome(ifelse(graduate, "fa-graduation-cap", "fa-female"))
breastfeedings <- ifelse(breastfeeding, "#7A378B", "#FF8811")

d <- crossing(x = 1:10,
              y = 1:10) %>%
  mutate(overweight = overweight,
         graduate = graduate,
         graduates = graduates,
         breastfeeding = breastfeeding,
         breastfeeding = breastfeeding) %>%
  mutate(overweight = ifelse(overweight == 1, "Yes","No"))
d$Overweight <- d$overweight

d2 <- d %>%
  mutate(breastfeeding = ifelse(breastfeeding, "Yes", "No")) %>%
  mutate(graduate = ifelse(graduate, "Yes", "No")) 

poverweightbreastfeeding <- d2 %>%
  filter(breastfeeding == "Yes") %>%
  prop( ~ overweight, success = "No", .) %>% 
  round(., digits = 2)

poverweightkbreastfeeding <- d2 %>%
  filter(breastfeeding == "No") %>%
  prop( ~ overweight, success = "No", .) %>% 
  round(., digits = 2)
```

Our fictitious study is reported in the media. 
A possible headline reads:

> Benefits of breastfeeding proven: `r poverweightbreastfeeding*100` % of children who were exclusively breastfed for 4 months are not overweight at age 6.


```{r beob1, echo=FALSE}
message <- "No variation means no correlation. Here, information is missing on how many children who were not breastfed turn out overweight."
question("Do the headline data alone suggest that breastfeeding is correlated with overweight?",
         answer("Yes"),
         answer("No", correct = TRUE, message = message),
		allow_retry = TRUE,
		correct = random_praise(),
		incorrect = random_encouragement()
         )
```

##

Knowing how many <purple>breastfed</purple> children did not become overweight is nice, but we still lack at least a comparison to  children who were <orange>not breastfed</orange>.

In the fictitious study, as reported in the headline, the probability of not overweight is $\color{purple}{`r poverweightbreastfeeding`}$ for <purple>breastfed</purple> children, and it is $\color{orange}{`r poverweightkbreastfeeding`}$ for children who were <orange>not breastfed</orange>.

Data were collected as part of an **observational study**, that is, mothers were simply asked about <green>breastfeeding</green> (<purple>Yes</purple> or <orange>No</orange>), and information about <blue>overweight</blue> was collected.

A comparison of the proportion not <blue>overweight</blue> according to <green>breastfeeding</green> reveals:

$$\color{purple}{`r poverweightbreastfeeding`}-\color{orange}{`r poverweightkbreastfeeding`}=`r (poverweightbreastfeeding-poverweightkbreastfeeding)`.$$

```{r beob2, echo=FALSE}
message <- "Graduate is a confounder and lies on a non-causal path from breastfeeding to overweight."
question("Does the observational study tell us that the average causal effect of breastfeeding on the probability of not overweight is $0.36$?",
         answer("Yes"),
         answer("No", correct = TRUE, message = message),
		allow_retry = TRUE,
		correct = random_praise(),
		incorrect = random_encouragement()
         )
```

##

The assumed model looked like this:

```{r DAG_Modell2, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='60%', fig.asp = .8}
plot(DAG_Modell)
```

This leads to the following distribution in the population:

```{r fig.showtext=TRUE, out.width="90%", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = .7, fig.align="center"}
pbeob <- ggplot(d, aes(x = x, y = y, color = Overweight)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white", linewidth = .5, aes(fill = Overweight), alpha = .2) +
  theme_void() +
  geom_text(family='fontawesome-webfont', size = 8, aes(label = graduates), colour = breastfeedings) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#A9BCF5", "#0B2161")) +
  labs(title = "Observational study") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
pbeob
```

Overweight occurs less often if <purple>breastfed</purple> than if <orange>not breastfed</orange>.

But: Graduates <purple>breastfeed</purple> more often than non-graduates &ndash; and children of graduates are less likely to be overweight.



## Randomized experiment

Assuming the causal model with only one confounder (here: <violet>graduate</violet>), we could simply adjust for this variable, as we have already learned.
But what if we did not collect the variable in our data? Then we wouldn't be able to adjust for it.


And, more importantly, of course there could be numerous other confounders here!

The traditional approach to determine average causal effects are **randomized controlled trials** (RCT). Arrows pointing into the variable $\color{green}{X}$ are eliminated and the assignment $do(\color{green}{X}=\color{green}{x})$ is randomized.

*Note*: Would a randomized experiment even be ethical and feasible for this question? 
Can we randomize which mothers breastfeed and which don't?
In the interview with economist Anne Brenøe, you can learn more about designs that can be used to study the causal effects of breastfeeding in practice.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='90%', fig.asp = .7}
plot(DAG_ModellE)
```

A possible outcome of a hypothetical experiment looks like this:

```{r fig.showtext=TRUE, out.width="90%", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = .7, fig.align="center"}

A comparison of the probabilities for not <blue>overweight</blue> according to <green>breastfeeding</green> now yields the following estimate of the average causal effect:

$$\color{purple}{`r poverweightbreastfeedinge`}-\color{orange}{`r poverweightkbreastfeedinge`}=`r (poverweightbreastfeedinge -poverweightkbreastfeedinge)`.$$

In the <red>fictious</red> observational study, our estimate was  biased because of the confounder <violet>graduate</violet>. 

In our <red>fictious</red> experiment, we no longer have to worry about this and other third variables because they cannot influence whether mothers breastfeed or not.

To move from pure prediction ("How likely is it that a randomly selected woman breastfeeds?") to **causal inference** ("What effect does breastfeeding have on the risk of the child becoming overweight?") requires more than just the data.
We need additional knowledge about how the data came to be &ndash; what additional variables influenced the variables of interest, or whether, for example, there was a randomized intervention.

*Note*: For reasons of statistical precision, it would be appropriate to include the variable <violet>graduate</violet> in the analysis even in a randomized experiment.

In his talk [Causal Thinking for Descriptive Research](https://speakerdeck.com/rmcelreath/causal-thinking-for-descriptive-research) Richard McElreath points out that we should *use honest methods for modest questions*:

1. What are we trying to describe?

2. What are the ideal data for doing so?

3. What data do we actually have?

4. What causes differences between (2) and (3)?

In this module, you have learned statistical methods for optimal data collection so that, whenever possible, no differences are found in between (2) and (3). 
Ideally, we have a random sample.
And ideally, there is random assignment to experimental groups.

Unfortunately, it doesn't always work like this in practice, and in some situations it is simply not possible.
