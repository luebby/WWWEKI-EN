## Tutorials

1. [A fork in the road: Walking one way – and not the other](https://fomshinyapps.shinyapps.io/WWWEKI_Modul_01_En/) (In this module, you will learn:
about potential outcomes, counterfactuals, how to define causal effects, and why causal inference is so challenging.)

2. [An arrow shows the way](https://fomshinyapps.shinyapps.io/WWWEKI_Modul_02_En/) (In this module, you will learn: about cause and effect, the basic of causal graphs: the meaning of an arrow, and of parents and children, about causal models, and the difference between observing and doing in the context of causal inference.)

3. [Analysing data - with which goal?](https://fomshinyapps.shinyapps.io/WWWEKI_Modul_03_En/) (In this module you will learn: how to distinguish between description, prediction, and causal inference, why thisd istinction is important and more about the causal ladder.))

4. [There is something between us](https://fomshinyapps.shinyapps.io/WWWEKI_Modul_04_En/) (In this module you will learn: about causal chains, mediators, and that sometimes it is better not to consider certain variables in the analysis.)

5. [Storks and babies](https://fomshinyapps.shinyapps.io/WWWEKI_Modul_05_En/) (In this module you will learn: about causal forks, confounders, and that common causes often lead to confusion.)

6. [Kind or handsome? Why not both?](https://fomshinyapps.shinyapps.io/WWWEKI_Modul_06_En/) (In this module you will learn: about inverted forks, colliders, and that we sometimes unintentionally create associations where there are none.)

7. [Why splitting rooms is not a good investment](https://fomshinyapps.shinyapps.io/WWWEKI_Modul_07_En/) (In this module you will learn: that an observation does not always allow us to derive a suitable action.)

8. [Randomness is Magic](https://fomshinyapps.shinyapps.io/WWWEKI_Modul_08_En/) (In this module you will learn more about: the different data requirements for description and prediction, the advantages of randomly drawn samples, and the advantages of random assignment in the context of experiments.)

9. [What would have been, if...?](https://fomshinyapps.shinyapps.io/WWWEKI_Modul_09_En/) (In this module you will learn: how to determine counterfactuals.)

10. [Drawing and reading graphs](https://fomshinyapps.shinyapps.io/WWWEKI_Modul_10_En/) (In this module you will learn to: draw a graph based on assumptions about the causal structure, use the graph to draw the right consequences for causal inference, run a simulation for the gender pay gap in R.)

11. [ Does smoking harm adolescents?](https://fomshinyapps.shinyapps.io/WWWEKI_Modul_11_En/) (In this module you will learn: how to determine a causal effect using linear regression in `R` based on a real-world example, how to determine which variables need to be adjusted in practice.)

12. [Interrogating Data in Practice](https://fomshinyapps.shinyapps.io/WWWEKI_Modul_12_Em/) (In this module you will learn: what critical data interrogation can look like in practice, what else there is to learn about causal inference beyond the basics.)
